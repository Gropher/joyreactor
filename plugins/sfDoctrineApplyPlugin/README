# sfDoctrineApply plugin #

Most public sites have similar needs where user registration is
concerned. In order to slow down spam a little bit and get a grip
on who's doing what, you want users to apply for accounts and 
confirm them by clicking on a link in an email message. 

Symfony's sfDoctrineGuardPlugin does a fine job managing the accounts you 
already have but doesn't provide a built-way for users to apply for and
create accounts. sfApply adds that capability.

sfDoctrineApplyPlugin also implements a password reset feature that works
correctly and also requires users to confirm via email. This prevents a 
user who has discovered a momentarily unattended PC from 
taking over the account too easily.

## Requirements ##

You need:

* Symfony 1.2

* sfDoctrineGuardPlugin

* Doctrine 

* SwiftMailer (see this 
[Symfony 
Cookbook article](http://www.symfony-project.org/cookbook/1_2/en/email) for installation instructions)

A Symfony 1.0-plus-Propel version of this plugin is also available
separately as sfApplyPlugin.

## Installation ##

Read the sfDoctrineGuardPlugin documentation first! Set up that plugin before
continuing.

Then add the following to your `doctrine/schema.yml`:

    sfGuardUserProfile:
      tableName: sf_guard_user_profile
      columns:
        id:
          type: integer(4)
          primary: true
          autoincrement: true
        user_id:
          type: integer(4)
          notnull: true
        email:
          type: string(80)
        fullname:
          type: string(80)
        validate:
          type: string(17)
      # Don't forget this!
      relations:
        User:
          class: sfGuardUser
          foreign: id
          local: user_id
          type: one  
          onDelete: cascade    
          foreignType: one
          foreignAlias: Profile

Note that sfDoctrineApplyPlugin takes advantage of the "user profile"
functionality offered by sfGuardPlugin as a place to store
additional information. While sfGuardPlugin makes the name of the
profile class configurable, sfDoctrineApplyPlugin simply uses the
default name (sfGuardUserProfile) for simplicity and because
it allows us to inherit from the sfGuardUserProfileForm class.

"But where do I put my own additional fields?" That's why I didn't
build sfGuardUserProfile's schema directly into the plugin. Just
add your additional fields after the full name field.

"Shouldn't there be yet another profile class for my stuff?" In theory,
that might be nice. In practice, before you know it you'll be joining 
28 tables every time someone accesses the page. Paste this one
snippet of code just once instead. You'll be happier in the long run.

Doctrine note: since Doctrine supports column aggregation inheritance,
it would also be possible for me to implement a Doctrine class from which you
inherit to add your own fields. While this is a good idea in many ways, 
many applications have an existing sfGuardUserProfile class and their 
developers are probably going to be happier just adding my handful of fields.
A REALLY big improvement would be for sfDoctrineGuard itself to endorse
column aggregation inheritance and not have a separate user
profile class at all. But anyway.

You will also want to add the following routes to your `config/routing.yml`.
The URLs are just suggestions, you can change them if you don't like them.
Note that this plugin provides a working solution for users who have 
forgotten their passwords. Mapping the `sf_guard_password` route to 
`sfApply/reset-request` allows the "forgot your password?" link in
the default sfGuardPlugin login form to work.

    apply:
      url:  /apply
      param: { module: sfApply, action: apply }

    reset:
      url: /reset
      param: { module: sfApply, action: reset }

    resetRequest:
      url: /reset-request
      param: { module: sfApply, action: resetRequest }

    validate:
      url: /confirm/:validate
      param: { module: sfApply, action: confirm }

    settings:
      url: /settings
      param: { module: sfApply, action: settings }

    # We implement the missing sf_guard_password feature from sfGuardPlugin
    sf_guard_password:
      url: /reset-request
      param: { module: sfApply, action: resetRequest }

In addition, by default, sfDoctrineApplyPlugin assumes you have
an @homepage route and various "Continue" links point there. If you 
don't have such a route or don't like that destination, set
`app_sfDoctrineApplyPlugin_after` to the route of your choice.

If you have enabled the built-in routes in sfGuardPlugin, 
then overriding `sf_guard_password` here might not work. You can
fix that by copying `sfGuardPlugin/modules/sfGuardAuth/templates/loginSuccess.php`
to your application and editing the "forgot your password?" link to
point to `sfApply/resetRequest` instead.

Activate the `sfApply` module in your application's
`settings.yml` file:

    enabled_modules:        [default, sfGuardAuth, sfApply]

Note that you also need the `sfGuardAuth` module to enable logins.

Configure the "from" address and full name for email messages sent by
sfDoctrineApplyPlugin in your `app.yml` file. Note that the key is
sfApplyPlugin, not sfDoctrineApplyPlugin, for compatibility with other versions:

      sfApplyPlugin:
        from:
          email: "your@emailaddress.com"
          fullname: "the staff at yoursite.com"


*Important: sfDoctrineApplyPlugin will not work* unless you configure these
options! The plugin will fail with a less than informative error message
(although a more informative one appears in the log file).
My apologies for leaving this rather important information out of the
documentation of the earliest versions.

SwiftMailer supports several means of delivery. By default, 
sfDoctrineApplyPlugin uses the NativeMail back end. If this is not what
you want, you can specify a different SwiftMailer back end:

      sfApplyPlugin:
        from:
          email: "your@emailaddress.com"
          fullname: "the staff at yoursite.com"
        mailer_type: "SMTP"

If you are using the SMTP backend, you can also enable encryption and
specify a mailer host and port:

      sfApplyPlugin:
        from:
          email: "your@emailaddress.com"
          fullname: "the staff at yoursite.com"
        mailer_type: "SMTP"
        mailer_smtp_encryption: true
        mailer_host: my.mailer.host
        mailer_port: 25

For a complete list of connection classes supported by SwiftMailer, 
see the [SwiftMailer documentation](http://www.swiftmailer.org/wikidocs/).

Now that you have configured the plugin, you can easily add a link to your 
pages sending users to `sfApply/apply` to request accounts:

    echo link_to("Create Account", "sfApply/apply");

You will almost certainly also want to copy 
sfGuardPlugin's `modules/sfGuardAuth/templates/signinSuccess.php` to
your own application's modules folder and add a "Create Account"
link to it, so that users understand they can make accounts 
of their own at what would otherwise be the most frustrating point 
in your application.

## Customizing Emails ##

sfApply sends out email messages inviting users to verify their
accounts or reset their passwords. You can customize these by
copying `modules/sfApply/templates/sendValidateNew.php` (HTML),
 `modules/sfApply/templates/sendValidateNewText.php` (plaintext),
`modules/sfApply/templates/sendValidateReset.php` (HTML),
and 
 `modules/sfApply/templates/sendValidateResetText.php` (plaintext),
from the plugin to
your application and editing them. The default emails aren't
that bad; they do contain the name of your site. But you really ought 
to customize these so that users get a warm, fuzzy, personal sense that the
messages are not spam. 

Note that all of our templates are I18N-ready for easy internationalization.
You might not be familiar with PHP's "heredoc" syntax:

    <<<EOM
    text
    goes
    here
    EOM

This quotes a string that extends for multiple lines with no
restrictions on the use of " and ' (but $ is still special if it
introduces a variable name for substitution). The heredoc syntax is
very useful for internationalizing longer snippets of text that
include HTML tags. We also use the variable substitution feature
of the `__` function.

## Displaying Login and Logout Prompts on Every Page ##

You probably have pages on which logging in is optional. It's nice to
display a login prompt directly on these pages. If you want to do that,
try including my login/logout prompt component from your
`apps/frontend/templates/layout.php` file:

    <?php include_component('sfApply', 'login') ?>

If you are using the provided stylesheet, the login prompt will
be floated at the far right, so you'll want to emit this code
before anything that should appear to the left of the prompt.

When the user is already logged in, the login prompt is 
automatically replaced by a logout prompt.

Note that you can suppress the login prompt on pages that do include
this partial by setting the `sf_apply_login` slot:

    <?php slot('sf_apply_login') ?>
    <?php end_slot() ?>

This can be useful when you wish to include the login partial in your
layout template but need to override it occasionally.

## Using the Suggested Stylesheet ##

sfApply comes with a stylesheet. You don't have to use it. If you do,
you'll get reasonable styles for the sfApply pages as well as a
reasonably good-looking style for the sfGuardPlugin login page. 

If you wish to use my stylesheet directly, first make sure you have a 
symbolic link from `web/sfDoctrineApplyPlugin` to `plugins/sfDoctrineApplyPlugin/web`. Then add
the stylesheet to your view.yml file:

      stylesheets:    [main, /sfDoctrineApplyPlugin/css/login-apply]

In the long run, you'll probably want to borrow from it rather than
using it directly.

## Extending sfApply ##

Of course, your user profile probably contains additional fields. How 
do you deal with them at application time and when the user is editing
their settings?

In the original sfApplyPlugin, it was necessary to add your own 
code to deal with additional fields.

In sfDoctrineApplyPlugin this is not necessary, although you will
indeed wind up writing *some* code in most cases.

First of all, sfApplyApplyForm and sfApplySettingsForm both
inherit from your sfGuardUserProfileForm class... which is automatically
generated by Doctrine and Symfony. And that means that
additional fields in your sfGuardUserProfile class
*automatically* show up in the application form and the settings form.
To understand how this works, see the 
[Doctrine Integration chapter of Symfony Forms in Action](http://www.symfony-project.org/book/forms/1_2/en/11-Doctrine-Integration).

Of course, in the real world, the automatically generated forms usually
aren't quite good enough. This isn't a problem because you can easily
add additional code to the `configure` method of your own 
`sfGuardUserProfileForm` class. Look at your application's
`lib/forms/sfGuardUserProfileForm.class.php` file and you'll
see that the configure method is there waiting for you.

Common changes here include removing fields the user should not
be allowed to edit with unset($this['fieldname']), adding new widgets
for fields that are not directly represented in the database, setting
widgets other than those provided by default, and adding new 
validators. You can do all of the above without breaking
the application and settings forms.

sfDoctrineApplyPlugin's form classes are subclasses of 
your sfGuardUserProfileForm class, so they automatically benefit
from your changes to that class.

In some cases, you may wish to make changes that take effect
*after* the changes that are made by the settings and application
forms. This is especially true if you want them to behave differently
with respect to your new fields. To do that, subclass
the sfDoctrineApplyApplyForm and sfDoctrineApplySettingsForm classes,
and tell sfDoctrineApplyPlugin to use your subclasses instead
via `app.yml`:

    all:
      sfApplyPlugin:
        # Application form class
        sfDoctrineApplyApplyForm_class: myApplyFormClass
        # Settings form class
        sfDoctrineApplySettingsForm_class: mySettingsFormClass
        # Password reset form class
        sfDoctrineApplyResetForm_class: myResetFormClass

If you subclass our form classes, *be sure to call*
`parent::configure()` at the beginning of *your* configure method.

You are not required to subclass our form classes. You can replace
the form classes entirely if you wish. But I don't really recommend it
as it just creates more work for you.

*Note*: subclassing forms that use postvalidators is a bit tricky if you
need to add postvalidators of your own. Here is one good way to do it,
taken from our sfDoctrineApplyApplyForm class:

    $schema = $this->validatorSchema;
    // Grab the existing postvalidator
    $postValidator = $schema->getPostValidator();
    // Create an array of new postvalidators we want to add
    $postValidators = array(
      new sfValidatorSchemaCompare(
        'password', sfValidatorSchemaCompare::EQUAL, 'password2',
        array(), array('invalid' => 'The passwords did not match.')),
      new sfValidatorSchemaCompare(
        'email', sfValidatorSchemaCompare::EQUAL, 'email2',
        array(), array('invalid' => 'The email addresses did not match.')));
    // if there is an existing postvalidator add it to the list
    if ($postValidator)
    {
      $postValidators[] = $postValidator;
    }
    // Put them all into effect with sfValidatorAnd
    $this->validatorSchema->setPostValidator(
      new sfValidatorAnd($postValidators));

With all of the power that Symfony 1.2 forms provide (hint: if you
can't do something you probably haven't looked at `doSave` or
`updateObject` yet), you probably won't need to write your own
sfApply actions class. But you can do that if you need to:

Copy `sfDoctrineApplyPlugin/modules/sfApply/actions/actions.class.php` to
your own `modules/sfApply/actions` folder. Notice that this class is
initially empty. That's because it inherits its default
behavior from 
`sfDoctrineApplyPlugin/modules/sfApply/lib/BasesfApplyActions.class.php`.

Of course, you can also copy and modify the templates. It is fairly
likely that you will want to do that, and you may very well
decide that `echo $form` is not enough control over layout and
presentation. That's fine. See the Symfony forms book for more
information about how to render each form element directly.

## Changelog ##

### Version 0.75 ###

One more stray reference to sfDoctrineApplyPlugin: as an app.yml key
in the documentation. Fixed.

### Version 0.74 ###

Thanks to Christian Schaefer for pointing out the following
documentation errors:

* References to varchar in the recommended schema, which should be string.
* Example of using the login component erroneously includes it as a partial.
* Documentation refers to sfDoctrineApplyPlugin: as a key in app.yml.
For backwards compatibility we use sfApplyPlugin: as a key in app.yml.

Thanks to Nicolas Massaviol for pointing out this one:

* Documentation now covers how to more fully configure SwiftMailer.

### Versions 0.71, 0.72 and 0.73 ###

Minor documentation issues.

### Version 0.7 ###

Version 0.7 is the first Doctrine / Symfony 1.2 version.

### Version 0.63 ###

Version 0.63 corrects a significant oversight: earlier versions
relied on sfGuardProfilePeer::retrieveUserByValidate() which
existed only in my application. I discovered this problem when
I employed the plugin a second application. This has
been fixed.

### Version 0.62 ###

Version 0.62 corrects a documentation bug: I neglected to mention
the importance of configuring the "from" address for emails sent
by sfDoctrineApplyPlugin. If you do not do so the account confirmation and
password reset email messages will never be sent. See above.

### Version 0.61 ###

Version 0.61 had a minor markdown problem with the README.

### Version 0.60 ###

Version 0.6 adds the optional sfApply/_login.php template, which provides
an easy way to insert a login prompt on every page. I realized I was
using this code in two sites and that others would likely want to 
do the same thing. Just include it in your layout template.

Version 0.6 also adds a suggested stylesheet. Use it or not as you
see fit. In addition to styling the apply and reset pages, it also
styles the standard sfGuardUser login page. 

Version 0.6 renames all of the CSS classes and ids emitted by sfDoctrineApplyPlugin
in order to avoid potential conflicts with your own CSS elements.

### Version 0.53 ###

Version 0.53 corrected Markdown errors in the documentation. There
were no code changes from version 0.5, which was the first 
public release.
